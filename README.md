**Laboratory 1:** Create a C program to find the sum of n natural numbers, compile it using gcc compiler. Verify the output of the C program after execution.

Step 1: Create a new sum1ton.c file in the desired directory in Linux environment.

Here, I am using the GEDIT text editor from Ubuntu.

Write and save your C program in the text editor.

Step 2: Compile your code using GCC compiler in the terminal window of Ubuntu enivronment and ensure there are no errors during compilation.

Step 3: After compilation, the executable will be generated. Run the executable in terminal window to see the ouput.

Final Output: In the below image we can observe the C code and the output together.
